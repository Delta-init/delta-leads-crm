 * good. The correction can't reach them (finance never had them to send
 * back), so the email is asked for here, inline, and saving sends the
 * enrolment to finance at once: the same enrolment, to the same finance
 * organization, with the email — kept on the lead too. Shown only where the
 * server says the email is what held it up (`needsClientEmail`), on My
 * Enrolments, the enrolment's page and the student's page.
 *
 * Whoever may not act on enrolments is told who can, rather than given a
 * field the server would refuse.
